Custom Extensions & Assignment
Openzeppelin
Your assignment is to create a new ERC20 token contract from the Openzeppelin
template ERC20PresetMinterPauser and add cap functionality. Meaning that
there is a maximum cap of token issuance. 

You should also build a new function that allows you to modify the cap.

You should also study the AccessControl contract from Openzeppelin and 
implement a new role in the same ERC20 contract. This role should be the only
one to be able to change the contract's cap.
