Project: Building a Decentralised DEX

Assignment
Build a DEX where a user can deposit ETH and ERC20 tokens.  The tokens can
be bought using ETH (but not other ERC-20 tokens).  Users should be able to
create both buy orders and sell orders, which will be stored in an on-chain
order book.  Users will also be able to place market orders (where they will
buy from the best offer in the the order book).
